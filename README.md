# Getting Started
This React Native app was developed using Expo. You will need to install the expo cli to view this project.
### Run 
#### *If the following command fails, try running it in an administrator shell.*
```shell
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Run the following command to see if you installed the expo-cli correctly. The version should pop up. If not, the expo cli is not installed correctly.
```shell
expo --version
```

# Running the Project On MacOS
## Meant to be viewed on iPhone 10, as it was the only testing environment I had.
You need to cd into the project folder, whichever folder you cloned it into. 
After you cd into the project folder, run
```shell
npm install
expo start
```

After running these commands, a new webpage should pop up. Within that webpage, on the left hand side, there should be a button which says "Run on IOS Simulator". Click this, and it should begin to run.

# *WARNING*
I am unable to test this on MacOS because I do not own a mac. If all else fails, underneath the "Run on IOS Simulator" button, there should be a button which says to run on web. Click it, and minimize the browser to match an iPhone 10 screen as closely as possible. The styles wont work exactly perfect, given the app was developed to match an iPhone 10 screen, but it is better than nothing.
